# BookFlow App

Welcome to the BookFlow App repository! This is where we manage the development of our library management application built using React.

## Project Overview

## Features

- User-friendly interface for scanning QR codes on books
- Efficient book issuance and return process
- Real-time availability status of books
- Search and filter functionality for easy book discovery
- Responsive design for optimal user experience on both desktop and mobile devices

## Technologies Used

- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- CSS3: Styling and layout
