# BookFlow App

Welcome to the BookFlow App repository! This is where we manage the development of our library management application built using React.

## Project Overview

BookFlow is a library management app that allows users to seamlessly manage book borrowing and returns using QR code scanning. This app aims to provide an efficient way to interact with library resources without the need for direct librarian involvement.
